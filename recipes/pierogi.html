        <h2>Descripion</h2>
        <p>This pierogi recipe for Polish dumplings has been a family favorite from generation 
            to generation. We traditionally make these for Christmas, but they can be made for 
            any special event. There's some work involved, but the outcome is rewarding! The 
            boiled pierogies can be fried in butter and onions or served with sour cream.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sauerkraut filling: Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
                Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes.
                 Add sauerkraut and cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 more minutes. 
                 Season with salt and pepper, then remove to a plate to cool.</li><br>
            <li>Make potato filling: Melt butter in the same skillet over medium heat.
                 Cook and stir onion in hot butter until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                 Stir in mashed potatoes, salt, and white pepper. Remove from heat.</li><br>
            <li>Make dough: Beat together sour cream and eggs in a large bowl until smooth.
                 Sift flour, baking powder, and salt into a separate bowl; stir into sour cream
                  mixture until dough comes together. Knead dough on a lightly floured surface
                   until firm and smooth. </li><br>
            <li>Divide dough in half, then roll out one half to 1/8-inch thickness. 
                Cut into 3-inch rounds using a biscuit cutter. Place a small spoonful
                 of potato filling into the center of each round. Moisten edges with 
                 water, fold over, and press with a fork to seal. Roll and fill remaining 
                 dough half with sauerkraut filling.</li><br>
             <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pierogies in batches 
                to boiling water and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                Remove with a slotted spoon.</li>    
        </ol>
