        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This stuffed cabbage recipe, known as halupki on the Ukrainian side of my family,
             is made with beef, pork, and rice encased in cabbage and drizzled with a thin, 
             sweet tomato sauce. My grandma Eugenia taught me how to make this. Every family has
              their own twist on this traditional dish.
             Enjoy with mashed potatoes just as we always do in my family!</p>
